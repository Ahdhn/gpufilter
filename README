Abstract:

The GPU-Efficient Recursive Filtering and Summed-Area Tables
(gpufilter) project is a set of C for CUDA functions to
compute recursive filters and summed-area tables in GPUs.  This
project presents a new algorithmic framework for parallel evaluation.
It partitions the image into 2D blocks, with a small band of data
buffered along each block perimeter.  A remarkable result is that the
image data is read only twice and written just once, independent of
image size, and thus total memory bandwidth is reduced even compared
to the traditional serial algorithm.

Installation:

    gpufilter code was written in C++ and C for CUDA and tested on
    Linux platform using gcc 4.4.4 of the Ubuntu distribution.  The
    library is built along with the examples and applications (see
    below) although part of the code is in the include/ directory.

Build:

    To run a number of examples and applications in this project, do:

    <in project root directory>
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

    After that, the binaries are created in ../bin and the main
    library (libgpufilter.a) is created in ../lib.  To run the
    examples execute in any order:

    $ ../bin/ex1
    $ ../bin/ex2
    $ ../bin/ex3
    $ ../bin/ex4

    There are also a number of applications to use in ../bin; to
    better understand each example and application see the
    corresponding source file in ../src and library headers in
    ../include.
