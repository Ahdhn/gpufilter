Abstract:

The gpufilter project is a set of C for CUDA functions to compute
recursive filters and summed-area tables in GPUs. This project
presents a new algorithmic framework for parallel evaluation. It
partitions the image into 2D blocks, with a small band of data
buffered along each block perimeter. A remarkable result is that the
image data is read only twice and written just once, independent of
image size, and thus total memory bandwidth is reduced even compared
to the traditional serial algorithm. The project is based on the
paper: "GPU-Efficient Recursive Filtering and Summed-Area Tables" by
Diego Nehab, Andr√© Maximo, Rodolfo S. Lima and Hugues Hoppe.
